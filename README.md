# Basic-JS-Projects

Trying out some Basic JS projects, Had to code along on YouTube for some... the goal is to work on projects to foster hands-on learning.

1. Simple Calculator - HTML, CSS & JavaScript were used for this project

2. ToDo-App - HTML, CSS & JavaScript were used for this project. Learned how to use "classList" and "appendChild" method.
